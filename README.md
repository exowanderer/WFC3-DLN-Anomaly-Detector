# WFC3-DLN-Anomaly-Detector
Use Deep Learning and Public Hubble-WFC3 data to identify 'anomalies' in Space observations (for HST and JWST)

This code started from an article on [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/16/keras-and-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns/).  Some of that code is still here; but most has been massively updatd with with keras examples.
